# MERN Stack Twitter Clone

My Twitter clone offers a comprehensive social media experience, allowing users to create and share text-based tweets and multimedia content. Users can interact with others by liking, commenting on, and following other users' posts. The home feed displays all tweets posted by the user, while the notifications section alerts users to likes, follows, and comments on their posts. In the profile section, users can update their personal information, change their password, and customize their profile with a new profile picture and banner image. Users can also filter their feed by selecting "following" in the home section to view only posts from the users they follow, or by selecting "likes" in the profile section to see all the posts they've liked.
